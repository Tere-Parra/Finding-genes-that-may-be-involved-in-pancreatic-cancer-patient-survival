# Differential-Expression-Analysis-of-Pancreatic-Cancer-Genes
The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) is a portal that contains a lot of projects related to cancer diseases. The GDC has transcriptomic, proteomic, genomic, and metabolomic data from Cancer patients. Here, I developed a pipeline to analyze a pancreatic cancer project. 

First, I introduced the project (ductal pancreatic cancer subtype)  and downloaded the data to create a counts data frame that we will use for the Differential Analysis Expression. Then I perform an Enrichment Analysis over the principal DEG genes.
